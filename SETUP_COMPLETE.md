# Setup Complete! 🎉

Your bookshelf application has been successfully converted from in-memory storage to PostgreSQL database persistence.

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### Database Migration
- ✅ PostgreSQL installed and running
- ✅ Database "bookshelf" created
- ✅ Schema migrations implemented with tables for:
  - `users` (authentication, profiles)
  - `books` (user's book library)
  - `follows` (social following system)
  - `activities` (activity feed)
- ✅ All models converted from in-memory arrays to PostgreSQL queries

### Backend Features Working
- ✅ User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- ✅ Book management (add, update, delete, categorize by status)
- ✅ User profiles with reading statistics
- ✅ Social features (following, followers)
- ✅ Activity feed showing reading activity across users
- ✅ All API endpoints tested and working

### Frontend Ready
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Configured to connect to backend on port 8000

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### 1. Backend Server
```bash
cd bookshelf-mvp/backend
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@14/bin:$PATH"
PORT=8000 npm run dev
```

The backend will:
- Automatically run database migrations
- Start server on port 8000
- Connect to PostgreSQL database

### 2. Frontend Application

**Important:** The frontend requires a special flag due to Node.js/OpenSSL compatibility:

```bash
cd bookshelf-mvp/frontend
NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npm start
```

**OR use the provided script:**
```bash
./start-frontend.sh
```

This will start the React frontend on port 3000 (or next available port).

## 🧪 Test the System

### API Endpoints (Backend on port 8000)
- Health check: `GET http://localhost:8000/health`
- Register user: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register`
- Login: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login`
- Add book: `POST http://localhost:8000/api/books`
- Get books: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/books`
- Activity feed: `GET http://localhost:8000/api/social/feed`

### Frontend Features
- User registration and login
- Add/edit/delete books with status (want-to-read, currently-reading, read)
- View reading statistics and profile
- Follow other users
- See activity feed of reading activity

## 📊 Database Test
```bash
cd bookshelf-mvp/backend
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@14/bin:$PATH"
node scripts/test-db.js
```

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)
Create `.env` file in backend directory:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=bookshelf
DB_USER=jackpacheco
DB_PASSWORD=
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-for-production
```

## ✨ New Features Added

1. **Database Persistence**: All data now stored in PostgreSQL instead of in-memory arrays
2. **Migrations**: Automatic database schema setup on startup
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error messages and database connection handling
4. **Improved Security**: Proper password hashing and JWT token management
5. **Scalability**: Database indexes for better performance
6. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and proper relationships

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

- **Database connection issues**: Check that PostgreSQL is running with `brew services list`
- **Port conflicts**: Change PORT environment variable if 8000 is in use
- **Migration errors**: Check database permissions and existing tables
- **Frontend API errors**: Ensure REACT_APP_API_URL points to correct backend URL

The application is now production-ready with proper database persistence! 🚀
